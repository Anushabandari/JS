Deployment process?
We developers are responsible to build and deploy the code in development environment using jenkins(tool used to build, test, 
and deploy the software)
Infrastructure team is responsible to build and deploy to QA environment using jenkins where QA will perform manual 
and functional testings and sign-offs on the build and then the same build code is pushed to production by Infrastucture
team using Jenkins.

How to improve the performance of the application

1) use CDN(content delivery network) urls for caching
2) include the javascript script file at the end of the html file
3) include 'DEFER' keyword for parallel download of the javascript files

    <script src="demo_defer.js" defer></script>
    
4) use lazy loading - delay the load of the unused files for later.

    const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./OtherComponent'));

5) minify the js code
    example: webpack
    
6) remove unsed code

Explain the architecture of the project?

example of the project structure

AfterPay
  |
   --> package.json (provides the metadata information of the application like.. packages installed)
   --> package-lock.json (it is auto generated by package.json which as specific information of the packages version installed)
   --> node_modules (auto generated which has all the files downloaded by npm - node package manager)
   --> webpack.js (It takes all the js files and converts into a single minified file)
   --> index.js
   --> route.js
   --> index.js
   --> api folder
   --> src 
        |
         --> components
                |
                 -->shared components
         --> redux
                |
                 --> store
                 --> reducers

We used Agile methodology   
- 2 weeks sprint
- we will have gromming meeting to gromm the stories for the following sprint(like verifying the requirements 
    and assign points)
- we will have planning on the day of the previous sprint end day to assign the sprint tasks to the team
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
testing
 - I used Jest and engyme for unit testing the application
