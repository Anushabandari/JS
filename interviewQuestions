=== vs == vs = ?
 "=" is used to assign a value to a variable.
  ex: var i= 10
 "==" is used to compare only values.
  ex: 1==1 - true 
      1=="1" - true 
  Note: == does the type coersion (converts into similar type.)   
"===" is used to compare both value and datatypes.
  ex: 1===1 - true 
      1==="1" - false(comparing datatype).
